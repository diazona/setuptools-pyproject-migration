"""
Tests of the plugin on real distribution packages.

"Distribution package" in this sense means a full-fledged project that has
source code and packaging metadata, as opposed to the mock projects created by
our test suite. In short, these tests run the plugin on real Python projects to
make sure it works. The tests run approximately the following procedure:

1. Acquire the source code of an "external" project
2. Build and package it in the standard way using a :pep:`517`-compliant
   build frontend, like `build <https://github.com/pypa/build>`_
3. Run ``python setup.py pyproject`` to convert the project's setuptools
   configuration to a ``pyproject.toml``
4. Build a wheel from that ``pyproject.toml``
5. Compare the two wheels to make sure there are no differences that stem from
   discrepancies in ``pyproject.toml``

In practice, the implementation takes some shortcuts to avoid _actually_
having to build all those wheel files, such as using already-published wheels
from PyPI. But verifying that the procedure above works is the ultimate goal.
