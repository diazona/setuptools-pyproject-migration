  # Environment variables to support color support (jaraco/skeleton#66):
  # Request colored output from CLI tools supporting it. Different tools
  # interpret the value differently. For some, just being set is sufficient.
  # For others, it must be a non-zero integer. For yet others, being set
  # to a non-empty value is sufficient. For tox, it must be one of
  # <blank>, 0, 1, false, no, off, on, true, yes. The only enabling value
  # in common is "1".
