Various improvements to distribution package test support:

* Create three separate implementations for how to access reference metadata:

  * From a file on PyPI
  * From a wheel
  * From an sdist

* Use caching to reduce unnecessary downloads and archive extractions
* Add implementation-specific subclasses of ``DistributionPackagePreparation``
* Move all state-changing operations, including reference metadata computation, out of
  ``DistributionPackage`` and into ``DistributionPackagePreparation``
* Replace ``DistributionPackage.prepare_source()`` with a new method ``prepare()`` that creates
  a ``DistributionPackagePreparation``
* Add ``make_importable`` flag to ``DistributionPackagePreparation``

Add ``parse_core_metadata()`` to parse core metadata from an ``RFC822Message`` into a ``StandardMetadata`` object

Elevate distribution package testing to a class with methods for individual fields
